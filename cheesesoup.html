</br>
<strong>Yield:</strong>
about 1 1/2 quarts (about 4 servings)
</br>
<h1>Ingredients:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>2 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>5 Ounces small diced onion (approx. 1 cup)</li>
    <li>5 Ounces small diced carrot (approx. 1 cup)</li>
    <li>5 Ounces small diced celery (approx. 1 cup)</li>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoon salt for sweating vegetables, plus more if needed at end of cooking</li>
    <li>3 Tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 Quart chicken broth, heated to a simmer</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 Cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>10 Ounces Fontina, shredded</li>
    <li>1 Teaspoon Marsala wine</li>
    <li>1 Teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoon white pepper</li>
</ul>
<h1>Directions:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Melt butter in large heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and salt. Sweat </br> 
    for 5 to 10 minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally. Sift the flour over the </br> 
    vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>  
    <li> Gradually add the chicken stock and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and add the </br>
    garlic and bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until vegetables are soft.</li>  
    <li>Remove bay leaf. Turn off the heat, add the heavy cream, and then puree with an immersion blender or in </br>
    a conventional blender*. Gradually add the cheese, 1 small handful at a time, and stir until melted before </br>
    adding next handful. Stir in the Marsala, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and white pepper. Taste and add </br>
    additional salt if desired. If soup is not hot enough, return to a low heat until warmed through.</li>
</ol>
<strong>*When boiling hot liquids: </strong>
Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer </br>
liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the </br>
lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse </br>
a few times then process on high speed until smooth.
