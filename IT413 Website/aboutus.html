<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
</br>
<p>
We are a small company formed in the heart of Los Angeles, California in 2004 with the intent to make all information
and books readily available to students at reasonable and affordable prices. Look... 
We know how hard it is to pay for college, work a job, and pay for textbooks that are 2, 3, 400 dollars. 
That is insane to ask of students who are already shelling out their life savings and taking out loans to get an education!
I should know, I was a business student for 4 years, and was appalled at prices for textbooks.
We have worked with textbook companies to sell new textbooks that they have made, but also with students who want to sell their used
textbooks for a reasonable price.

<h3>Who is the founder?</h3>
<p> I, Anthony Pietrzak, am the founder of this company, SeerOfBooks.com. I founded this idea back in 2004 and have formualted it into a renowned website for students to get some extra money for selling their old textbooks,
while also selling new textbooks from publishers for reasonable prices as well.

<h3> What about access codes?</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, while we have worked to get access codes on this website for a reasonable price, we cannot offer them. 
These codes are at the disposal of the publishers who offer them, and so far none of them would like to make a deal with us to sell them
for a good price to students. We are sorry, but would like to add this as an offer in the near future, should we reach an
agreement with the publishers who offer them.
